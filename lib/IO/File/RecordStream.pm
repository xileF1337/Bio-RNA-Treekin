=head1 NAME

IO::File::RecordStream - Read multi-line records from a file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::RNA::Treekin;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Auxiliary class to read records consisting of multiple lines, separated by a
separator matching a specified regular expression.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 IO::File::RecordStream->new($file_name, @args)

=head2 IO::File::RecordStream->new($file_handle)

Construct a new record stream from a file name or handle.

=over

=item Mandatory arguments:

=over

=item file_name | file_handle

Name of or handle to file to read data from. Pass either

=item match_separator

Quoted regular expression matching the record separator. The input file is
split at every match.

=item record_factory

A code ref that, when called with an array ref containing the lines of a
single record, parses the data and constructs a record object.

=back

=back

Additionally, the constructor can be called with a single file name or file
handle (without keyword). This requires to override the C<match_separator> and
C<record_factory> attributes to provide default values.

=head2 $stream->next

Returns the next record object. Internally, the input file is read until the
next match of the C<match_separator>. The data is passed on to the
C<record_factory> and the returned record object is returned.

=head2 $stream->file_name

Return the name of the file that this object reads data from. May be C<undef>
if the data was read from a handle. Use predicate C<has_file_name> to query
its presence.

=head2 $stream->has_file_name

Predicate query whether a file name has been used to read the data.

=head2 $stream->file_handle

Handle to the file the data is being read from.

=head2 $stream->end_reached

Query whether the input file was read completely yet.

=head2 $stream->match_separator

Returns the matching expression used to identify the record separator.
