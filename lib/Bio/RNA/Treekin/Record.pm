=head1 NAME

Bio::RNA::Treekin::Record - Parse, query, and manipulate I<Treekin> output.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::RNA::Treekin;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parses a regular output file of I<Treekin>. Allows to query population data
as well as additional info from the header. New minima can be generated. The
stringification returns, again, a valid I<Treekin> file which can be, e. g.,
visualized using I<Grace>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

These attributes of the class allow to query various data from the header of
the input file.

=head2 date

The time and date of the I<Treekin> run.

=head2 sequence

The RNA sequence for which the simulation was computed.

=head2 method

The method used to build the transition matrix as documented for the
C<--method> switch of I<Treekin>.

=head2 start_time

Initial time of the simulation.

=head2 stop_time

Time at which the simulation stops.

=head2 temperature

Temperature of the simulation in degrees Celsius.

=head2 basename

Name of the input file. May be C<< <stdin> >> if data was read from standard
input.

=head2 time_increment

Factor by which the time is multiplied in each simulation step (roughly, the
truth is more complicated).

=head2 degeneracy

Whether to consider degeneracy in transition rates.

=head2 absorbing_state

The states specified as absorbing do not have any outgoing transitions and
thus serve as "population sinks" during the simulation.

=head2 states_limit

Maximum number of states (???). Value is always (?) 2^31 = 2147483647.

=head2 info

A free text field containing additional comments.

Only available in I<some> of the records of a I<BarMap> multi-record file. Use
predicate C<has_info> to check whether this attribute is available.

=head2 init_population

The initial population specified by the user. This information is extracted
from the C<cmd> attribute.

Only available in I<BarMap>'s multi-record files. Use predicate
C<has_init_population> to check whether this attribute is available.

=head2 rates_file

The file that the rate matrix was read from.

Only available in I<BarMap>'s multi-record files. Use predicate
C<has_rates_file> to check whether this attribute is available.

=head2 file_index

Zero-based index given to the input files in the order they were read.
Extracted from the C<rates_file> attribute.

Use predicate C<has_file_index> to check whether this attribute is available.

=head2 cmd

The command used to invoke I<Treekin>. Only available in I<BarMap>'s
multi-record files.

Use predicate C<has_cmd> to check whether this attribute is available.


=head1 METHODS

These methods allow the construction, querying and manipulation of the record
objects and its population data.

=head2 Bio::RNA::Treekin::Record->new($treekin_file)

=head2 Bio::RNA::Treekin::Record->new($treekin_handle)

Construct a new record from a (single) I<Treekin> file.

=head2 $record->population_data_count

Return the number of population data records, i. e. the number of simulated
time steps, including the start time.

=head2 $record->min_count

Return the number of minima.

=head2 $record->mins

Return the list of all contained minima, i. e. C<< 1...$record->min_count >>

=head2 $record->keep_mins(@kept_minima)

Remove all minima but the ones from C<@kept_minima>. The list is sorted and
de-duplicated first.

=head2 $record->splice_mins(@kept_minima)

Like C<keep_mins()>, but do not sort / de-duplicate, but use C<@kept_minima>
as is. This can be used to remove, duplicate or reorder minima.

=head2 $record->max_pop_of_min($minimum)

Get the maximum population value of all time points for a specific C<$minimum>.

=head2 $record->pops_of_min($minimum)

Get a list of the populations at all time points (in chronological order) for
a single C<$minimum>.

=head2 $record->final_population

Get the last population data record, an object of class
L<Bio::RNA::Treekin::PopulationDataRecord>. It contains the population data
for all minima at the C<stop_time>.

=head2 $record->population($i)

Get the C<$i>-th population data record, an object of class
L<Bio::RNA::Treekin::PopulationDataRecord>. C<$i> is a zero-based index in
chronological order.

=head2 $record->populations

Returns the list of all population data records. Useful for iterating.

=head2 $record->add_min

Add a single new minimum with all-zero entries. Data can then be appended to
this new min using C<append_pop_data()>.

Returns the index of the new minimum.

=head2 $record->append_pop_data($pop_data_ref, $append_to_min_ref)

Given a list of population data records C<$pop_data_ref>, append them to the
population data of this record.

The columns of the added data can be
re-arranged on the fly by providing a mapping C<$append_to_min_ref> (a hash
ref) giving for each minimum in C<$pop_data_ref> (key) a
minimum in the current population data (value) to which the new minimum should
be swapped. If no data is provided for some minimum of this record, its
population is set to zero in the newly added entries.

=head2 $record->stringify

=head2 "$record"

Returns the record as a I<Treekin> file.
