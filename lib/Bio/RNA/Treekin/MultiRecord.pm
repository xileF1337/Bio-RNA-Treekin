=head1 NAME

Bio::RNA::Treekin::MultiRecord - Stream records from a multi-record I<Treekin>
file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::RNA::Treekin;

    # Open the multi-record Treekin file.
    my $record_stream = Bio::RNA::Treekin::MultiRecord->new(
                            'multi_treekin.out');

    # Iterate over the individual records.
    while (defined (my $record = $record_stream->next)) {
        ...         # do something with the Treekin record
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a stream to read individual records from multi-record
I<Treekin> files as generated by the RNA folding simulation tool I<BarMap>.

=head1 METHODS

This class extends L<IO::File::RecordStream> and offers the same methods.
Below, only the differences are described.

=head2 Bio::RNA::Treekin::MultiRecord->new($treekin_file)

=head2 Bio::RNA::Treekin::MultiRecord->new($treekin_handle)

Constructs a new record stream for a multi-I<Treekin> file, i. e. an output
file as generated by the I<BarMap> scripts, which were developed by the
Theoretical Biochemistry Group (TBI) of the University of Vienna. These files
look like a concatenation of multiple regular I<Treekin> files, where the
individual file contents are separated by a line consisting only of "&" (a
syntax borrowed from the I<Grace> visualization software).

Both a path to the file or a handle can be passed to the constructor.

=head2 $record_stream->next

Return the next I<Treekin> record from the multi-record I<Treekin> file,
represented as an object of class L<Bio::RNA::Treekin::Record>.
